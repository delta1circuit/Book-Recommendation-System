# Book-Recommendation-System
A recommendation system, which is a subclass of information filtering systems, aims to anticipate the rating or preference a user may assign to a certain item. Such a system bascially recommends useful products to people.
With everything being readily available on the internet, the world lacks a standard of recommending books the way everyone are recommended movies, products or even music. Regular reading with the correct books encourages the best patterns of brain growth, which aids in creating strong neural connections and, in turn, the development of language, literacy, and social and emotional abilities that may have a positive impact on one's health for the rest of one's life.
To achieve this, we use content based filtering, with Nearest Neighbours as as algorithm to find the 10 most similar books. We also compare how well cosine similarity does in comparison to Nearest Neighbors
The dataset used is the Goodreads-Books dataset available on Kaggle. (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)
Additionally some Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing is done to get some useful insights into the dataset.
The repository contains: Code, Dataset, Presentation recording.
To run the code:

Import the notebook and the dataset to kaggle (or download the dataset and notebook and change the filepath if you are running it locTally)
Run all cells.
For recommendation, provide an input with a title that is present in the dataset.
